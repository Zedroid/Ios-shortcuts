Via Action Button

Open Action Button Settings (Settings -> “Action Button”)
Set it to “Shortcut”
Choose your shortcut
Now when you hold the action button, it takes a silent screenshot but also reverts the sound mode back to normal after.

Save text from webpages to iOS Notes app 
What Does It Do?
It saves the text of a webpage to the iOS Notes app. I use it primarily for saving news and academic articles I find interesting.
(I am not the creator of this shortcut. I found it via a now defunct database of user created workflows and thought others might find it useful too.)
It can be downloaded here
Documentation (included with original workflow)
This workflow is used to save the text of web pages in the Apple iOS Notes application.
It creates a text note with the following characteristics:
Uppercase title
Metadata of the document, including publication date, original URL and author
Details of the context in which the note was saved (current location and date)
Body of the note formatted as Markdown (ready to be copied to another app)
Also, the URL of the saved page is stored in the Clipboard just in case
